# Commercial License Information

## Why a Commercial License?

This project is dual-licensed under AGPL-3.0+ and a commercial license. The AGPL requires that if you modify this software and provide it as a network service, you must make your source code available to users.

If you want to:
- Use this code in a proprietary SaaS product
- Modify the code without sharing your changes
- Deploy without source code disclosure requirements
- Avoid AGPL copyleft obligations

...then you need a commercial license.
