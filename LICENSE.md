## FAQ

### Q: Can I use this for free?
**A:** Yes! Under AGPL-3.0+, you can use it completely free as long as you comply with the license terms.

### Q: What if I modify the code for my SaaS product?
**A:** Under AGPL, you must make your modifications available to your users. If you don't want to do this, you need a commercial license.
