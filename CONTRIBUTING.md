# Contributing to PitchCoach

## Contributions Not Accepted

This project is **source-available but not accepting external contributions**. 

### Why?

This is a commercial project with a dual-license model (AGPL-3.0+ / Commercial). To maintain clear licensing and intellectual property rights for commercial licensing, we cannot accept external contributions.

### What You Can Do Instead

1. **Fork for Your Own Use**
   - Fork the project under AGPL-3.0+ terms
   - Modify for your own needs
   - Share your fork if you comply with AGPL

2. **Report Issues**
   - Found a bug? Open an issue
   - We'll review and fix if valid
   - Include reproduction steps

3. **Request Features**
   - Open an issue with your feature idea
   - We'll consider it for future releases
   - No guarantee of implementation

4. **Commercial License Feedback**
   - Have suggestions for commercial features?
   - Email: support@driftrail.com
   - May be implemented in future versions

## Why This Approach?

Accepting contributions would require a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) that assigns copyright to the project maintainers. This adds legal complexity and friction.

Instead, we keep the codebase clean, maintain full control over licensing, and can offer commercial licenses without legal complications.
